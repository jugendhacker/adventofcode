These are my solutions to the AdventOfCode challenges written in Golang.

# How to get

## Download

Every commit on the main branch is build and release via Github Actions.

To get the build results just go to the release tab. There you could find binarys for linux and windows.

## Experienced Gopher: build it yourself

Just build the whole module with

```bash
go build -v .
```

# Usage

All my solutions are compile into a single binary and you could run it with

```bash
adventofcode -d 1 /path/to/input
```

For more information see

```bash
adventofcode --help
```
